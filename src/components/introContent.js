Just a couple quick things, and
<strong class="new-line">
you really only need to read this 1<sup>st</sup> slide for
context
</strong>
. <strong class="new-line">This is NOT</strong> so much
<strong>a resum&#233;</strong> as
<strong>it is a portfolio</strong>. I just decided to use my 24
years of experience as the primary source of data (all from a
single
<a href="assets/js/resume.json.js" target="_blank">
JSON object
</a>
), and I do not expect anyone to actually read any of this.
<strong class="new-line">
Your goal here is to get a feel for what I CAN do, moreso than
what I have done
</strong>
, and
<strong class="new-line">
the target audience is someone that understands Web Development
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
<strong class="new-line">
This is an example of what I can do in about 1 week's time
</strong>
. Call it
<strong class="new-line">a personal coding challenge</strong>,
or better yet,
<strong class="new-line">my digital playground</strong>. Just
be aware that it may be a bit "rough around the edges" for a short
time. If you simply want my professional history, go to my

. You can also get a copy of my
<strong>
<a href="/assets/resume.pdf" target="_blank">
single page resum&#233;

</strong>
here.
</p>
<p>
<strong class="new-line">If you'd like more context</strong>,
like why I did this, the approach I took, the tools &amp;
resources I used, what I plan on doing next with this, etc...
<strong>click "Next"</strong>. And for your convenience, I created
(invented?) a
<span class="show-me highlight-brevity">
<i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i> brevity feature
</span>
to spare you from the filler words that some may find annoying.
</p>
<p>
<strong class="new-line">
Otherwise, just close this minor annoyance
</strong>
and peruse away. BTW,
<strong class="new-line">
there are 2 themes currently. One is very basic, and the other
looks like Nicki Minaj and Office Max had a baby
</strong>
. Use the theme link in the
<span class="show-me highlight-menu">
<i class="fas fa-bars"></i> menu
</span>
to toggle between them.

<strong class="new-line">
This is not your traditional portfolio
</strong>
. Much of my last several years of work has been focussed on
internal or subscription-based web applications vs public-facing
sites.
</p>
<p>
Again,
<strong class="new-line">
the bulk of this was done in 1 week
</strong>
. My focus was speed, and therefore
<strong class="new-line">
there is quite a bit of refining to be done
</strong>
. I just wanted to get something recent and representative of my
skillset up and running quickly. I'm also integrating feedback and
adding features as they come to me. If it seems that I've ignored
any particular aspect i.e: W3C validation, WCAG compliance,
browser coverage, device coverage, more Intuitivityness(sm)...
this will have all of those.
<strong class="new-line">
It's currently just a prototype
</strong>
and not what I would consider production quality.
</p>
<p>
At this point, and with exception to a few minor bugs,
<strong class="new-line">
everything should be pretty solid when
</strong>
viewed on desktop or laptop
<strong>using any recent browser not made by Microsoft</strong>,
and
<strong class="new-line">
I'm about 80% there for tablets and phones

Aside from coding challenges, I've had no need for a "portfolio"
for over 8 years now. And that dusty old portfolio was tucked
safely away on a CD, in a non-descript box, mixed in with many
other boxes waiting to be dealt with some day - one day. I also
certainly would
<strong class="new-line">
never keep any IP for myself that rightfully belongs to anyone
paying me
</strong>
to invent &amp; produce it. I should also add that
<strong class="new-line">
the highest value I can bring to a project is nothing that can
be gazed upon
</strong>
. But according to every non-developer individual I speak to
lately, it would seem I require something to look at. (I wonder if
LinkedIn is aware of how useless they've become.)
<strong class="new-line">
This would be great read in Morgan Freeman's voice
</strong>
BTW.
</p>
<p>
That all said, sure, I'll take screenshots every now and again and
email them to myself. You see, Gmail has been my primary storage
provider since... well, forever. And
<strong class="new-line">
there was a time when I had screenshots as recent as about 6
months ago
</strong>
... until
<strong class="new-line">
Google informed me that I was running out of space
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
What could possibly go wrong if I were to quickly free up space by
deleting every email attachment I've ever received that was over
1MB in size? Actually, I'm not that careless.
<strong class="new-line">
I carefully sifted through everything
</strong>
prior to said deletion
<strong>
and backed the important items up to a usb thumb drive
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
Cut to December 2019 and a disasterous, overly time consuming,
2012 Macbook upgrade to Catalina.
<strong class="new-line">
I needed a bootable usb drive STAT
</strong>
to bring this ordeal to a speedy end.

Now I know what you're thinking... That's a bit unfortunate, but
he did do it to himself. You're probably also thinking: IF we hire
this guy, he is NOT allowed to write documentation!!!

<p>How to (generally) prepare for a project:</p>
<ol class="orderly">
<li>
Define existing problem(s), barrier(s), bottleneck(s), missing
piece(s)...

<li>
Establish the need(s), value(s), audience(s), and combinations
therein.

<li>
Determine core features and set project scope &amp; constraints.
</li>
<li>Wireframe &amp; Prototype.</li>
<li>
Lock down a definition of done, environment(s), testing,
integration, metrics...
</li>
<li>
Define intervals for assessing progress and possible changes.

<li>
<strong class="new-line">GO!</strong>

Yeah, I didn't do any of that

, except for the last 2. And I so nailed it! Seriously, it's been
a lot of fun, but
<strong class="new-line">
I should have self-imposed at least a few additional best
practices
</strong>
, even though it was a rushed pet/personal project. I certainly
will be, going forward. But
<strong class="new-line">
all things considered, I knocked out a pretty substantial
prototype in a week

I'm definitely the person for that

When knocking out a rapid prototype,

like a semantic use of markup or jQuery for roughing out more
dynamic aspects.

compliance or using the required flavor or JS framework

SUCCESS!!!...(?) <strong class="new-line">Cleanup</strong>.
You have or will soon notice that many aspects of this are in an
80% done state. There's incomplete or missing content, some of the
font and color choices are questionable, and several aspects of
positioning and interaction need more attention. So
<strong class="new-line">here's the TODO list:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong class="new-line">
Highly encourage, gratefully accept, and consider any and all
feedback
</strong>
.
</li>
<li>
<strong class="new-line">
Lock this down in its current prototypical state and publish
all further development to a new subdomain
</strong>
. After all, you can't have a "before &amp; after" if there's no
before available.
</li>
<li>
<strong class="new-line">
Add Google Analytics, metrics and event tracking
</strong>
to the "before" protoytpe to aid in the refinement of the
"after".
</li>
<li>
Evaluate interactive aspects, consistency, and adjust
accordingly.
</li>
<li>Add W3C and WCAG compliance.</li>
<li>Refine font and color choices for both themes.</li>
<li>
Simplify and clean up the CSS &amp; JS, including any swearing
in the comments.
</li>
<li>Ensure I'm not infringing on anyone's IP.</li>
<li>Fill in all content blanks and check speeling.</li>
<li>Test theming by adding a new one (requests?)</li>
<li>Add more easter eggs. Did you find them all?</li>
<li>
<strong class="new-line">
Port this to Semantic-UI/React

"That's nice, a full version of your resum&#233, but could you
please provide a portfolio?"
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This introduction that you are currently reading was not yet
created on the day I first started directing people here, when
asked for a portfolio. Above is
<strong class="new-line">
a direct quote from a recruiter
</strong>
that was essentially echoed by a few more. A couple of friends
simply asked me "What am I looking at again?"
</p>
<p>
"<strong class="new-line">Context is ev-er-y-thing</strong>"
has been my #1 personal mantra since before my last 24 years of
development. When I was a surgical assistant, if I didn't know
exactly what to do, when I had to do it, there could be grave
circumstances. I started as a human surgical UI, and have since
translated that skill to the interfaces I produce. And
<strong class="new-line">
while I'm very good at being context aware, I'm certainly not
perfect
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
In my rush to get this together, I never saw it as anything other
than a portfolio. But clearly that wasn't the case for anyone that
couldn't read my mind.
<strong class="new-line">
I should have stepped back at some point, or better yet,
assembled a rough plan before going at it
</strong>
. That's my takeaway here. And
<strong class="new-line">
I'm grateful that this UI has yet to injure or kill anyone
</strong>
... yet.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I may have gone a bit too crazy with the shadows and
animations. I should tone that down a bit.
