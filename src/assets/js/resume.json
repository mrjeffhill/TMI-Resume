To be clear: <i>THIS is the portfolio</i>. The content therein just happens to be my professional history.</p><p>You're probably here because you've either seen my 1-page resum&#233 and would like to see more, or I referred you here due to a lack of code & design samples from the last several years. <i>Long story short</i>, it involved an urgent need for a bootable macOS thumbdrive, and a prior large file purge from Google Drive.</p><p>You could also call this a 1-week <i>personal coding challenge</i>. My only goal starting out was to get something out there to look at. I had no design planned, other than to create something interesting using semantic markup (barely any divs or spans - as it should be) and a few popular frameworks/APIs, and magic tricks. Currently there are only 2 themes. One is quite basic with very little styling, and the other resembles an Agile board. I will be adding drastically different themes that only modify the CSS - leaving the base markup intact.</p><p> Warning: If you've never done Agile (and properly), what you're about to see may scare you, and my design choices may seem questionable. Otherwise, I think you'll dig this. I also welcome any questions concerning my design, accessibility and interaction choices. However, the answer to many of them will likely be that I did all of this in 1 week!</p><p>A few more thoughts before you continue:</p><dl><dt>The primary takeaway (at this point in time) should be speed v accuracy.</dt><dd>The vast majority of this took place from Feb 4th - Mar 2nd, 2020. Unless or until this introduction is updated to guarantee the quality of particular features, this purely reflects my riffing chops.</dd><dt>There are currently several aspects that are incomplete.</dt><dd>There may be missing or incomplete content, something may not look right on a particular device, there's code that isn't production-ready, and likely a few misspeelings (due to my current macbook keyboard issues)... This is currently a flaws-and-all sandbox, undergoing continual refinement.</dd><dt>Want to give me a coding or design challenge?</dt><dd>Bring it on! And if you don't already have something prepared, perhaps adding a new feature/refinement to this project would be suitable.</dd></dl>",
